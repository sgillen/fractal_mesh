# Shrinking Fractional Dimensions With Reinforcement Learning

This repo contains code to accompony the CORL 2020 paper: Explicitly Encouraging Low Fractional Dimensional Trajectories Via Reinforcement Learning. 

This directory contains the original manuscript as a pdf, a short accompnying video, and the source code to replicate the results found in the paper.  

It contains a modified implementation of Augmented Random Search which modifies rewards obtained from reinforcement learning environments in order to explicitly encourage agents to find policies which induce trajectories with a small fractional dimension.
